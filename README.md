# shopping_cart
Our project aims to develop a robust shopping cart application using the Spring MVC framework with Hibernate integration. This application will provide users with a seamless shopping experience, allowing them to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality to ensure secure access to the application.
2. Product Management: Enable administrators to add, edit, and delete products from the inventory.
3. Shopping Cart: Allow users to add products to their cart, view cart contents, update quantities, and remove items.
4. Integration with Hibernate: Utilize Hibernate for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database, ensuring efficient data management and persistence.
5. Responsive Design: Implement a responsive user interface to ensure compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
